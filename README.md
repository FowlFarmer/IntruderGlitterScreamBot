## Robot Package

This little guy drives up to you whenever you open the front door, and asks for a password. Upon 2 failed attempts, it sprays glitter all over you (so you look very guilty) and runs around like a headless chicken, screaming "INTRUDER ALERT AAH!!!"

- Uses OpenCV to detect people and is capable of wall detection pathing
- AI voice recognition allows for a voice -> words -> password detection vector
- Utilizes NVIDIA Jetson Nano and STM32 MCU
- Very speedy boi (important)
